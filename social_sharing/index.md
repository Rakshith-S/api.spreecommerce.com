#Adding Social Sharing Buttons#  


Adding social media buttons to your product listings enables your store visitors to spread the word about your products. We offer the ability to add the following social media buttons:

+**Twitter** - Allows your store visitors to tweet a link to your product in their Twitter feed.

+**Facebook** - Allows your store visitors to like your product on their Facebook profile. 

+**Pinterest** - Allows your store visitors to add your product to their Pinterest pinboard. Your product image will be added to their pinboard and will link back to your product URL.

+**Google** - Allows your store visitors to +1 your product on their Google Plus account to indicate that they recommend your product. 

+**Delicious** - Allows your store visitors to save the link to your product in their Delicious account so they can return to your product page at a later time.

+**Reddit** - Allows your store visitors to submit a link to your product to the Reddit social news feed. 

+**Tumblr** - Allows your store visitors to link to your product on their Tumblr blog.

To select which social media sharing buttons appear on each of your product listings, log into your SpreeWorks account. Click on **Manage** and then scroll over **Configuration**. In the Configuration drop down menu, select **Sharing**.
