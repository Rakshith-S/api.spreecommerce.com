#Setting Up Taxes#

Spreeworks has partnered with TaxCloud to make calculating sales tax quick and easy for our customers. TaxCloud is a free internet sales tax calculation service designed especially for e-commerce merchants. TaxCloud calculates sales tax for all of the approximately 13,000 sales tax jurisdictions in the United States. This includes every state that has sales tax. They work with the [Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board](http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/) to provide the most up-to-date and accurate tax rate information. 

TaxCloud automatically tracks and integrates any changes to state and local tax codes and rates, so the correct tax is charged every time and you maintain compliance with all local sales tax laws. The best part is that TaxCloud is free and secure. There are no set-up fees or transactions fees of any kind. We communicate with TaxCloud via a real-time web services API using SSL protocol and a unique ID and key for every merchant. No customer data is stored on the TaxCloud servers. 

To set up TaxCloud for your store, log into your SpreeWorks account. Click on **Manage** and then scroll over **Configuration**. In the **Configuration** drop down menu, select **Taxes**.
