## Start Accepting Payments Online

SpreeWorks has partnered with Stripe to allow our customers to start accepting online payments instantly. Stripe is a payment processor that allows you to accept payments via MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club. Stripe costs 2.9% + 30 cents per successful transaction. There are no setup or monthly fees and no contracts. You only get charged when you make money. Payment for successful transactions are deposited to your bank account seven days later. 

To sign up for Stripe, log in to your SpreeWorks account. Click on the **Manage option**. Then navigate to the **Configuration** menu and select the **Payment** option as illustrated in Figure A.

You’ll need to complete a short information page to sign up for your Stripe account. Start by providing some basic information about your business as displayed in Figure C. This includes your company’s legal entity type and your Employer Identification Number (EIN). Note: An EIN is not required for Individual/Sole Proprietorships and LLCs. If you are a Corporation or Non-profit and do not have an EIN, click **Apply Online** to access the Internal Revenue Service application to acquire one.

Enter your full name, date of birth and the last four digits of your social security number so that Stripe can verify your identity. Next enter the business name and phone number you want to appear on your customers’ credit card statements. Then provide the routing number and account number for the bank account where you would like the payments from your customers to be deposited. Finally enter your email address and a password to create your Stripe account. Click **Connect SpreeWorks with my Stripe account** and you’re all done! You can now begin accepting payments online at your store.
