The API in Spree has had some minor changes in the 1.2.x release, as well as in the 1.3.0 release. They are listed below. Please ensure your API clients are updated accordingly.

## Standardize variant response

Previously, variant data was returned like this:

<%= json [ :variant => { :product_id => 1 }] %>

But products were returned like this:

<%= json :products => [ :product => { :id => 1 }] %>

To standardize these responses, variants will now be returned underneath a `variants` key in the JSON response, like this:

<%= json :variants => [ :variant => { :product_id => 1 }] %>
