## Calculators

Spree makes extensive use of the Spree::Calculator model and there are several
subclasses provided to deal with various types of calculations (flat rate,
percentage discount, sales tax, VAT, etc.) All calculators extend the
Spree::Calculator class and must provide the following methods:

    def self.description
      # Human readable description of the calculator
    end

    def compute(object=nil)
      # Returns the value after performing the required calculation
    end

Calculators link to a `calculable` object, which are typically one of
`Spree::ShippingMethod`, `Spree::TaxRate` or
`Spree::Promotion::Actions::CreateAdjustment`. These three clasees use the
<%= link_to "`Spree::Core::CalculatedAdjustment`", "#calculated-adjustments" %>
module to provide an easy way to calculate adjustments for their objects.

## Available Calculators

The following are descriptions of the currently available calculators in Spree.
If you would like to add your own, please see the 
<%= link_to "Registering a calculator", "#registering-a-calculator" %> section.

### Default Tax

For information about this calculator, please read the "Taxation" guide.

### Flat Percent Per Item Total

This calculator has one preference: `flat_percent` and can be set like this:

    calculator.preferred_flat_percent = 10

This calculator takes an order and calculates an amount using this calculation:

    [item total] x [flat percentage]

For example, if an order had an item total of $31 and the calculator was
configured to have a flat percent amount of 10, the discount would be $3.10,
because:

    $31 x 10% = $3.10 

### Flat Rate

This calculator can be used to provide a flat rate discount.

This calculator has two preferences: `amount` and `currency`. These can be set
like this:

    calculator.preferred_amount = 10
    calculator.currency = "USD"

The currency for this calculator is used to check to see if a shipping method is
available for an order. If an order's currency does not match the shipping
method's currency, then that shipping method will not be displayed on the
frontend. 

This calculator can take any object and will return simply the preferred amount.

### Flexi Rate

This calculator is typically used for promotional discounts when you want a
specific discount for the first product, and then subsequent discounts for other
products, up until a certain amount.

This calculator takes three preferences:

* `first_item`: The discounted price of the items.
* `max_items`: The maximum number of items this discount applies to.
* `additional_item`: The discounted price of subsequent items.

The calculator computes based on this:

([first item discount] x [max items]) + ([items_count] - [max items] x [additional item discount])

### Free Shipping

This calculator will takes an object, and then works out the shipping total for
that object. Useful for when you want to apply free shipping to an order.

### Per Item

The Per Item calculator computes a value for every item within an order. This is
useful for providing a discount for a specific product, without it affecting
others.

This calculator takes two preferences:

* `amount`: The amount per item to calculate.
* `currency`: The currency for this calculator. 

This calculator depends on its `calcuable` responding to a `promotion` method,
which should return a `Spree::Promotion` (or similar) object. This object should
then return a list of rules, which should respond to a `products` method. This
is used to return a result of matching products.

The list of matching products is compared against the line items for the order
being calculated. If any of the matching products are included in the order,
they are eligible for this calculator. The calculation is this:

    [matching product quantity] x [amount]

Every matching product within an order will add to the calculator's total. For
example, assuming the calculator has an amount of "5" and there's an order 
with the following line items:

* Product A: $15.00 x 2 (within matching products)
* Product B: $10.00 x 1 (within matching products)
* Product C: $20.00 x 4 (excluded from matching products)

The calculation would be:

     (2 x 5) + (1 x 5)

Meaning the calculator will compute an amount of "15".

### Percent Per Item

The Per Item calculator works in a near-identical fashion to the 
<%= link_to "Per Item calculator", "#per-item" %>, with the exception of rather
than providing a flat-rate per item, it is a percentage.

Assuming a calculator amount of 10% and an order such as this:

* Product A: $15.00 x 2 (within matching products)
* Product B: $10.00 x 1 (within matching products)
* Product C: $20.00 x 4 (excluded from matching products)

The calculation would be:

     ($15 x 2 x 10%) + ($10 x 10%)
     (30 x 10%) + ($10 x 10%)
     $3 + $1

Which is $4.

### Price Sack

The Price Sack calculator is useful for when you want to provide a discount for
an order which is over a certain price. The calcuator has four preferences:

TODO: Verify these preferences are correct. I am not confident.

* `minimal_amount`: The minimal amount to trigger the calculator.
* `normal_amount`: The normal amount of discount to apply if the calculator
  isn't full applied.
* `discount_amount`: The discount amount to apply.

## Creating a new calculator

To create a new calculator for Spree, you need to do two things. The first is to
inherit from the `Spree::Calculator` class and define `description` and
`compute` methods on that class:

    class CustomCalculator < Spree::Calculator
      def self.description
        # Human readable description of the calculator
      end

      def compute(object=nil)
        # Returns the value after performing the required calculation
      end
    end

You can register this calculator as a tax, shipping, or promotion adjustment
calculator by calling code like this at the end of
`config/initializers/spree.rb` inside your application (`config` variable
defined for brevity):

    config = Rails.application.config
    config.spree.calculators.shipping_methods << CustomCalculator
    config.spree.calculators.tax_rates << CustomCalculator
    config.spree.calculators.promotion_actions_create_adjustments << CustomCalculator

### Determining availability

By default, all shipping method calculators are available at all times. If you
wish to make this dependent on something from the order, you can re-define the
`available?` method inside your calculator:

    class CustomCalculator < Spree::Calculator
      def available?(object)
        object.currency == "USD"
      end
    end

## Calculated Adjustments

If you wish to use Spree's calculator functionality for your own application,
you can include the `Spree::Core::CalculatedAdjustments` module into a model of
your choosing.

    class Plan < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Spree::Core::CalculatedAdjustments
    end

To have calculators available for this class, you will need to register them:

    config.spree.calculators.plans << CustomCalculator

Then you can access these calculators by calling this method:

    Plan.calculators

Using this method, you can then display the calculators as you please. Each
object for this new class will need to have a calculator associated so that
adjustments can be calculated on them.

This module provides a `has_one` association to a `calculator` object, as well
as some convenience helpers for creating and updating adjustments for objects.
Assuming that an object has a calculator associated with it first, creating an
adjustment is simple:

    plan.create_adjustment("#{plan.name}", <target object>, <calculable object>)

To update this adjustment:

    plan.update_adjustment(<adjustment object>, <calculable object>)

To work out what the calculator would compute an amount to be:

    plan.compute_amount(<calculable object>)

`create_adjustment`, `update_adjustment` and `compute_amount` will call `compute` on
the `calculator` object. This calcualable amount is whatever object your
`CustomCalculator` class supports.
