# Price

Price objects track a price for a particular currency and variant combination.
For instance, a [variant](/developer/core/models/variant) may be available for
$15 (15 USD) and â‚¬7 (7 Euro).

This presence or lack of a price for a variant in a particular currency will
determine if that variant is visible in the frontend. If no variants of a
product have a particular price value for the current currency, that product
will not be visible in the frontend.
