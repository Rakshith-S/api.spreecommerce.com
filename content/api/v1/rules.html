# Rules

The following are some simple rules that all Spree API endpoints comply with.

1. All successful requests for the API will return a status of 200. 
2. Successful create and update requests will result in a status of 201 and 200 respectively. 
3. Both create and update requests will return Spree\'s representation of the data upon success. 
4. If a create or update request fails, a status code of 422 will be returned, with a hash containing an \"error\" key, and an \"errors\" key. The errors value will contain all ActiveRecord validation errors encountered when saving this record. 
5. Delete requests will return status of 200, and no content. 
6. Requests that list collections, such as /api/products will return a limited result set back. 
7. Requests that list collections can be paginated through by passing a page parameter that is a number greater than 0. 
8. If a resource can not be found, the API will return a status of 404. 
9. Unauthorized requests will be met with a 401 response.
