You will be presented the option to **Clear All Product Records** or to **Clear All Data**.  Clearing all product records will clear all of the sample products as well as any products you created. Clearing all data will delete all of the sample products, any products you created, all of the sample order data, and any real orders that you or your customers have placed.

Enter the following details for your product:

**Name** - The name for the product as you would like it to appear in your store. 

**Price** - The price that you would like to charge for the product. 

**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** - An identifier that you assign to the product to uniquely identify it in your store. The value can be alphabetic or numeric. 

**Weight** - The weight of the product. This value is utilized to calculate shipping costs based on the shipping settings you establish.

**Shipping Profile** - The shipping profile that you would like to apply to this product. Shipping Profiles are used to define a set of shipping rules and costs that you can quickly assign to a product. See TBD for how to configure Shipping Profiles.

**Count** - The number of units currently in stock for this product. When units of this product are sold, this number will automatically decrease.

**Description** - Information about the product that helps customers decide if they want to purchase the product. You can use the options at the top to format the text with options such as bold, italics, and bullets.

To add an image of your product click the **Add New Image** icon. A dialog box will appear allowing you to browse for images on your computer. Select the image you would like to add and click **Open**. You can add multiple images for each product. You can also change the order that images appear by left clicking the image and dragging it to the desired location. To delete a product image, scroll over the image and click on the garbage can icon.

Next, decide if you would like to associate a group or category with your product. Groups and categories will appear as options that visitors can utilize to more easily browse the products in your store. For example, if you are selling clothing then you might create a group called **Brand** and a category called **Spree**. A store visitor could view all of the clothing items for a particular brand name as illustrated in Figure G below.

**Figure G:**

To add a new group click the **New Group** button and enter the group name in the field that appears. Click **Save** once done. Any existing groups and categories that you have already created will appear in the **Categories** area.

You can also add variations to your product. Variations are options that visitors can select when purchasing a product. For example, if you are selling a shirt you might want to give customers the option of purchasing that shirt in the colors red or blue and sizes small or medium. 

To enter a product variant click the **Add Variation** button. You will be given the option to add the following information for your product variant. 

**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** - An identifier that you assign to this product variant to uniquely identify it in your store. The value can be alphabetic or numeric. If you do not enter a value for this field, it will be auto-populated with a generic SKU generated by the SpreeWorks system.

**Count** - The number of units currently in stock for this product variant. When units of this product variant are sold, this number will automatically decrease. If you do not enter a value for this field, it will be auto-populated with a value of zero. 

**Weight** - The weight of the product variant. This value is utilized to calculate shipping costs based on the shipping settings you establish.

**Options** - The option that you would like to provide customers when purchasing this product. You can specify both an option type and an option value. For example, **Type = Color** and **Value = Red**. The format for the **Option** field is **Option Type : Option Value**.  When adding multiple options for the same variant separate the values with a comma so that the format for this field is **Option Type : Option Value, Option Type : Option Value**. You must create a new variant for each option.

For example, if you would like to give customers the option to purchase a shirt in the colors red or blue and sizes small or medium you would create four variants with the following values in the **Options** field.

Color: Red, Size: Small
Color: Blue, Size: Small
Color: Red, Size: Medium
Color: Blue, Size Medium
