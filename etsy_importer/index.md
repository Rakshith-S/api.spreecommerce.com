#Importing Your Product Listings from Etsy#


SpreeWorks allows you to import your product data from your Etsy store. First, you will need to download your product information from your Etsy store. Log in to your Etsy account and click on **Your Shop**. Then find the **Shop Settings** section in the left panel and click on **Options**. Click on the **Download Data** tab and select the **Download CSV** button to save the file to your computer. The CSV file includes the listing title, description, price, currency code, quantity, tags, materials and image URLs for all of your active Etsy product listings.

Next, decide if you would like to associate a group or category with each of your products. Groups and categories will appear as options that visitors can utilize to more easily browse the products in your store. For example, if you are selling clothing then you might create a group called **Brand** and a category called **Spree**. A store visitor could view all of the clothing items for a particular brand name as illustrated in Figure B below.

You can assign groups and categories in bulk when you import your Etsy file to SpreeWorks. Open the .CSV file that you downloaded from Etsy and add a column called **Categories**. In this column, enter the group and category names that you would like to associate with each product using the following format **Group|Category**. Here is an example of how your .CSV file would appear for **Group = Brand** and **Category = Spree**.

**Figure C:**

You can associate multiple groups and categories with a product at the same time. Use the same format as above with a comma separating the two data sets - **Group|Category, Group|Category**. Here is an example if you wanted to associate the following groups and categories with Spree Baseball Jersey:

**Data Set #1**
Group  = Brand
Category = Spree

**Data Set #2**
Group = Clothing
Category = Jerseys

Your entry in the **Categories** column should appear as **Brand|Spree, Clothing|Jerseys** as illustrated in Figure D below.

**Figure D:**

Once your .CSV product listing file is updated with your desired groups and categories log in to your SpreeWorks account to upload the file to your store. Go to the **Manage** tab and click on **Products** in the menu. Scroll down to the bottom of your product list and click on the **Import Spreadsheet** button to upload your Etsy product listings.

Give us a few minutes to import your data. Once the import is complete your Etsy products will appear in your SpreeWorks product list.
